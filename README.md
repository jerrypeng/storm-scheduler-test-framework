# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to have a framework that allows users to run simulations on scheduling strategies and evaluate the effectiveness of the schedulings via a set of metrics.  The framework can also allow users to run fuzz testing to validate that the scheduling strategies are need implementated correctly.

## Using the Framework

The framework is organized similar to Apache storm.  Performance tests or fuzz tests can be implemented and run as junit tests.
